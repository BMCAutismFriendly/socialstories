## Navigating Creation of BMC Social Stories
# File storage structure 
Files should be stored in the relevant folders in the **master** branch, or within their subfolders.
# Page structure 
Pages should be referenced in hrefs by URL. There should be one .html page for folder if possible -- a file index.html in a folder "socialstories/myFolder" should be referenced with href "https://bmcautismfriendly.github.io/socialstories/myFolder/".
